# Buffering submission

## Introduction
A feature in Armonik.Extensions.Csharp allows buffered submission of tasks even if the submission calls are made iteratively. It is possible for the client to buffer task submissions when sending them.

In the situation where a client cannot control its iterative task submission calls, two function calls named ```public async Task<string> SubmitAsync(...)``` have been made available in ArmoniK.DevelopmentKit.Client.Unified. 

The asynchronous methods SubmitAsync allows first to iteratively submit tasks without waiting for the taskId results. 
The buffer is submitted when it is full, or after a specified time, whichever comes first. When it is sent after the specified time, the buffer might not be full.
A new buffer will then be made available to create a new batch of sends

## Buffer configuration

The buffering can be set from the object `Properties` provided when the Service is created
Here below an example of configuration : 
```csharp
var props = new Properties(TaskOptions,
                             configuration.GetSection("Grpc")["EndPoint"])
              {
                MaxConcurrentBuffer = 10,
                MaxTasksPerBuffer   = 50,
                MaxParallelChannel  = 5,
                TimeTriggerBuffer   = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10),
              };
```
where :
`MaxConcurrentBuffer` is the number of buffers that can be filled in asynchronous submitAsync calls

`MaxTasksPerBuffer` is the capacity of one buffer to contain tasks before a sending trigger

`MaxParallelChannel` is number of parallel grpc channel active able to submit in parallel

`TimeTriggerBuffer` is a TimeSpan to trigger a buffer to be sended over a grpc channel

In this example there are 10 buffers of 50 tasks each that will be sent over 5 Grpc channels in parallel. In other words, 2 buffers of 50 tasks will be prepared per Grpc channel

## Submission method
The functions are the following:

The method below will asynchronously send the task without arguments serialization
```csharp
public async Task<string> SubmitAsync(string                    methodName,
                                      byte[]                    argument,
                                      IServiceInvocationHandler handler,
                                      CancellationToken         token = default)
```


The method below will asynchronously send the task and serialize arguments objects
```csharp
public async Task<string> SubmitAsync(string                    methodName,
                                        object[]                  argument,
                                        IServiceInvocationHandler handler,
                                        CancellationToken         token = default)
```

### Creation and configuration Unified service

This is the instanciation and configuration of Unified service
```csharp
  public class StressTests
  {
    public StressTests(IConfiguration configuration,
                       ILoggerFactory factory,
                       string         partition)
    {
      TaskOptions = new TaskOptions
                    {
                      MaxDuration = new Duration
                                    {
                                      Seconds = 3600 * 24,
                                    },
                      MaxRetries           = 3,
                      Priority             = 1,
                      EngineType           = EngineType.Unified.ToString(),
                      ApplicationVersion   = "1.0.0-700",
                      ApplicationService   = "ServiceApps",
                      ApplicationName      = "Armonik.Samples.StressTests.Worker",
                      ApplicationNamespace = "Armonik.Samples.StressTests.Worker",
                      PartitionId          = partition,
                    };

      var props = new Properties(TaskOptions,
                             configuration.GetSection("Grpc")["EndPoint"])
              {
                MaxConcurrentBuffer = 5,
                MaxTasksPerBuffer   = 50,
                MaxParallelChannel  = 5,
                TimeTriggerBuffer   = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10),
              };

      Logger = factory.CreateLogger<StressTests>();

      Service = ServiceFactory.CreateService(Props,
                                             factory);

      ResultHandle = new ResultForStressTestsHandler(Logger);
    }
```
